:wave: Hi there! IÂ´m Facundo ðŸ‘‹

:book: I'm a student currently studying at a bootcamp in Montevideo, Uruguay. 

:speech_balloon: I spend around 8 hours a day in class learning a range of skills, including HTML, CSS, advanced JavaScript, command-line usage, Git, Node.js with Express, MySQL, Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, MongoDB, REST APIs, JWT, SPAs, and React. I'm passionate about coding and love to work on personal projects outside of class. 

:speech_balloon: As someone who speaks both Spanish and English, I'm excited to collaborate with developers from all around the world. Looking forward to connecting with the Github community!

:snowflake: Winter team :snowflake:
