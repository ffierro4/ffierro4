# :wave: Hi there! IÂ´m Facundo ðŸ‘‹

:book: I'm a trainee currently studying at [Hack Academy](https://ha.dev/).

:speech_balloon: IÂ´m learning a range of skills, including HTML, CSS, advanced JavaScript, Node.js & Express, command-line usage, Git, MySQL, Model-View-Controller architecture (MVC), MongoDB, REST APIs, JWT, SPAs, and React. I'm passionate about coding and love to work on personal projects outside class. 

:speech_balloon: As someone who speaks both Spanish and English, I'm excited to collaborate with developers from all around the world. Looking forward to connect with the Github community!
